## Why, What, How: Practical introduction to SPARQL for biologists and informaticians. 

This tutorial uses real world [UniProt](http://www.uniprot.org) and [neXtProt](https://search.nextprot.org) databases as illustrative examples

In order to follow this tutorial, you will need <a href="https://github.com/calipho-sib/sparql-playground" target="_blank">Sparql Playground</a>. Please [download the version 1.2.0](https://github.com/calipho-sib/sparql-playground/archive/1.2.0.zip) and make sure to have Java 1.7 or higher installed on your laptop.

*To check your java version, open your command line and type `java -version`*

### Motivation
More and more bioinformatics databases are deploying SPARQL endpoints allowing detail access to the information and data contained in them. This introduces how biologists and informaticians can use SPARQL to make it easier to integrate data and execute experiments with information provided by public resources combined with their own private experimental data to gain insight and gather supporting evidence. We will show how bioinformatics can stop parsing file formats and start answering scientific questions.

We will show you what SPARQL is:
* Who uses it.
* How you can use it.
* When should you use it.
 
### Expected goals
* Gain basic knowledge about SPARQL and its practical applications.
* Get an introduction to the neXtProt and UniProt databases and how you can use SPARQL to get answers to complicated questions.
* Show the tools and help we provide (example queries, data model browser)
* Demonstrate that SPARQL is not complicated and can be integrated in existing workflows e.g. R, command line, Excel, REST APIs.
* To learn how federated queries can be used to combine data in multiple databases so as to answer hard scientific questions.
* Explain how neXtProt and UniProtKB are complementary and how both add extra scientific value when combined.
